# Mini-Projects
Mini fun projects in java by prashant

The repository contains mini games and one other small project.They are as follows:

* ### ASCII Art
  
   The program converts images and text to ASCII art, i.e. text file with a lot of text characters representing the actual text and images. Have a look [here](https://gist.github.com/Geek8080/a495a68efb45d912d2ed577f6f8dd70c#gistcomment-3358029)
   
* ### Pong Game
    The game is similar to the classic pong game by atari. It has one player and one CPU saving the ball and making points. Here's a preview:

* ### Galaga
    This game is similar to the 90sarcade game galaga. You can find the original game gameplay on this [YouTube link](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjmppjMw7jqAhV30TgGHfs7DRQQwqsBMAB6BAgZEAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DdvjapcHsqXY&usg=AOvVaw2ggBRB9bnxYHVWBXFNcKW9). My game was similar but I would still want to play the old arcade game againðŸ˜…. Here's the gameplay of my version:

* ### Brick Breaker
    This was my favourite game to play as a kid and I still kinda' like it. Developing this was very fun and challenging as I had to check for collision of ball with a lot of objects at once. Anyways, here's a preview:
